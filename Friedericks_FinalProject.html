Like a book with a thousand words in it that just keep going and going and going and going.  They never stop and just keep going and going and going.  This is the worlds longest paragraph, it's a really long line of dialog for one actor to read in one go.  It would take about five minutes to read this whole paragraph.  That's how long this line of dialog is!  It's the longest paragraph in the world.  Longer than any other paragraph you've ever read.  You've never read a paragraph this long before.  You just haven't.  It's virtually impossible for you to read a paragraph this long in one sitting.  You will probably have to take a few breaks while you're reading this.  I mean, you're eyes will get tired.  Really tired, because this is long.  Did I mention how long this paragraph was?  I thought I did.  Well, in case you haven't already realized how long this is, here's a comparison.  Imagine you were reading the longest book in the world.  Did you imagine that yet?  Do you have that image in your mind yet?  Are you ready?  This paragraph is longer than that!  Can you believe that?  Longer than the longest book in the world!  WOW!"
